# q3dviewer

q3dviewer is a VS Code extension for viewing point cloud files (`.pcd`, `.ply`, `.las`, `.laz`, `.e57`) in 3D.
It embeds a q3dweb-based WebView so you can inspect point clouds directly inside the editor by rotating, panning, and zooming.

## Highlights

1. Opens `.pcd`, `.ply`, `.las`, `.laz`, and `.e57` files directly in a VS Code custom editor.
2. Supports three viewer modes: `cloud_viewer`, `film_maker`, and `realtime_viewer`.
3. Streams large files from the extension host to the WebView in chunks.
4. Down-samples very large point clouds automatically when the available memory budget is tight.
5. Supports map overlay for georeferenced LAS and LAZ files.

## Usage

1. Install this extension in VS Code.
2. Open a `.pcd`, `.ply`, `.las`, `.laz`, or `.e57` file.
3. If the file does not open automatically, use "Reopen With..." and select
   **Point Cloud Viewer**.
4. Press `M` to show or hide the settings panel.

### 1. Viewer Modes

The settings panel starts with a `Viewer Mode` selector.

| UI Label | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `cloud_viewer` | Inspect the currently opened point cloud file. |
| `film_maker` | Create key frames, preview camera motion, and record fly-through videos. |
| `realtime_viewer` | Connect to rosbridge and visualize live `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` data together with odometry. |

When you switch back to `cloud_viewer`, the currently opened file is loaded again from the VS Code side.

### 2. Basic Controls

After the file is opened in the custom editor, you can inspect it with the mouse and keyboard.

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Right drag | Rotate |
| Left drag | Pan |
| Mouse wheel | Zoom |
| `W` `A` `S` `D` `Z` `X` | Move camera |
| `Shift` + move keys | Faster movement |
| `Ctrl + Left Click` | Measure distance between two points |
| `Ctrl + Right Click` | Reset measurement points |
| `M` | Toggle settings menu (preserves the active tab) |
| `Space` (`film_maker` mode) | Add key frame from current camera |
| `Delete` (`film_maker` mode) | Remove current key frame |

### 3. Cloud Viewer

`cloud_viewer` is the default mode for opened files.

- The extension streams file contents to the WebView in chunks instead of loading the entire file at once into one message.
- Very large point clouds are automatically down-sampled when needed to stay within the available memory budget.
- File changes on disk are reflected when the custom editor reloads the cloud.

### 4. LAS / LAZ Map Overlay

If a LAS or LAZ file includes coordinate reference system information, q3dweb can read it and overlay the point cloud on map tiles.

The following map sources are available by default.

- OpenStreetMap
- GSI Standard Map
- GSI Pale Map
- GSI Seamless Aerial Photo
- GSI Blank Map

### 5. Realtime Viewer

Switch `Viewer Mode` to `realtime_viewer` to connect the WebView to rosbridge.

The realtime panel lets you configure:

- ROS Bridge URL
- Cloud Topic
- Odom Topic
- Max Points / Scan
- Max Accumulated Points

After you click `Connect`, the viewer subscribes to:

- `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` on the configured cloud topic
- `nav_msgs/Odometry` on the configured odometry topic

This mode is useful when you want to inspect a live robot map without leaving VS Code.

- Realtime mode requires a reachable rosbridge WebSocket endpoint.

### 6. Creating Demo Videos

q3dweb also includes a Film Maker workflow for creating camera fly-throughs. Switch `Viewer Mode` to `film_maker`, save camera positions as key frames, and preview the interpolated camera motion.

You can then record and download the playback as a video file. The default setting targets MP4/H.264 when the browser supports it and otherwise falls back to another MediaRecorder-compatible format.

### 7. Distance Measuring

You can measure distance by holding Control and left-clicking.

If you click multiple times, you can also measure the total length.

Press Control and right-click to undo.

## Supported Formats

- **PCD** (`.pcd`): binary and ASCII
- **PLY** (`.ply`): ASCII, binary little-endian, binary big-endian
- **LAS** (`.las`): point data record formats 0–3, 6–8
- **LAZ** (`.laz`): LAZ-compressed LAS via `laz-perf`
- **E57** (`.e57`): XYZ / RGB / intensity via a bundled Rust + WebAssembly reader
- Large files are transferred to the WebView in chunks to keep memory use bounded
- Very large inputs may be down-sampled automatically before rendering
